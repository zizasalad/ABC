    <h1>BEST RECORD STORES</h1>
    <h2>AROUND THE WORLD</h2>
    <p>Cheerfully remembering his childhood records collection, with shiny vinyl on the cover, Gram found the record store that would change his life: Record Bar, a sprawling vinyl emporium with enormous bins of records. A short wait later he found a long-awaited record he wanted to buy, a compilation of the jazz record label Blue Note.

    <p>"Of course, I came home and found the record was pure vinyl vinyl with a vinyl record store across the street, so I could easily find a replacement record to go with the album I already had," Gram says. "And I bought the vinyl record."
    </p>
    <p>Moments later, he proudly showed his record store purchase to his girlfriend, who was impressed and mildly disgusted by the strangeness of vinyl records.</p>

    <p>At that moment, his girlfriend was the first person Gram had introduced the concept of vinyl to. "People who are into vinyl are happy that I have it, and my friends' parents can be happy that I am too," Gram says. "But the last thing I want to do is force my friend to bring over his record collection for us to share.

    <p>Vinyl has come a long way from the simple wall-mounted phonograph record player of the 1940s. Records are now permanently recorded onto sheets of vinyl.
